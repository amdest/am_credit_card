Why?
----

ActiveMerchant has [nice credit card validations][3], but also lots of [dependencies][4] and other code.
That's fine for those using the rest of ActiveMerchant, but if you're just after it's credit card model/validations, this is for you.


Usage
-----

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "am_credit_card"
```

```ruby
# Instantiation
card = ActiveMerchant::Billing::CreditCard.new(
  :first_name         => "Bob",
  :last_name          => "Bobsen",
  :number             => "4242424242424242",
  :month              => "8",
  :year               => "2012",
  :verification_value => "123"
)

# Validation
card.valid?
card.errors
```
